# TestWatchFace
This is a test aplication that creates a watch face.  To keep the app running so it looks like a watchFace goto Settings->General->Wake Screen->"On Screen Raise Show Last App" and set to "Always"

This app shows the time (top right hand corner) and the app name (top left hand corner).  The rest of the screen is divided up to Day, Date, Month, Year
and in the centre is an analog dial showing the seconds

Rotate the Digital crown to change the colours.

The code was developed for my Series 3 apple watch (44mm) and needs to be changed to fit the full range of watches.

This code is free to use, I only ask you mention me.
Thanks
